# AirQ

This application is designed to show some information about Air Quality

# Used Tools

- Swift

The main language of the whole Apple ecosystem. Used to write the whole idea and logic of the application

- UIKit

The framework used to create, build and manipulate the UI of our application

- Cocoapods

Very handy tool to install third-party libraries. In our case we have used DropDown, which is helpful to create a DropDown menu. Great thing about this library is that it can make the view of the menu swipeable when it is needed. 

- AirVisual API

This API is hosted by iqair.com and can get all the basic info about Air Quality like supported countries, states, cities and their air quality indexes in both US and Chinese formats






❗️Note that I did not use Alamofire to decode the JSON file coming from our API. Yes, all of the work was done in a custom way
